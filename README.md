# Predicting Hotel Reservation Cancellations
Authored by Jae Heon Kim
## Overview
With the advent of the post-pandemic world, traditional travel industries are facing sharp increase in reservation cancellations. Given the economic uncertainties and rising wages, Hilton is aiming to optimize its resources by correctly identifying instances of reservation cancellations.
## Business Understanding
Hilton is a prominent hospitality brand in the hotel industry that faces stiff competition from non-traditional rivals like Airbnb in the tech-oriented post-pandemic world. Hilton is confronting challenges of accurately predicting its reservation cancellations as it holds the key to optimal allocation of resources without falling short of customers' expectations. 


So we are creating a machine-learning prediction model that predicts whether a reservation will be cancelled. This model can make two types of mistakes:
- Predicted cancellation was wrong: This is not a problem as our stakeholders will still make business.
- Predicted non-cancellation was wrong. This is a huge problem as there are lost expected revenue and increased spending on overstaffing.

We want to build a prediction model that minimizes both of these errors, but with greater emphasis on reducing the second type of error.
